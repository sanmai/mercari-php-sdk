# Mercari API PHP SDK 

So, I wanted to snipe up a rare item from Mercari. If you ever tried to buy something rare, you know items go away in literal seconds. Almost inhumanly fast. And you guessed it, there's API to enable bots for sophisticated buyers. 

Obtaining API credentials is a complex process, as Mercari is quite selective about who they grant it to. However, they also have a somewhat naive approach to internet security, requiring users to establish a local authenticated proxy server to allow their engineers to work with the API from the comfort of their homes. That's how yours truly gets to play with the API and buy something nice. In return, you get an API client, but please don't ask me for credentials or accesses.

Also, I had the New Year's holidays on my hands, so I spent a few more hours making a more or less complete implementation of the API. As I might need to make more purchases in the future, I might make a few tweaks here and there, but generally speaking, I expect you, the user of this API client, to pull the duty of adding new methods, etc.
