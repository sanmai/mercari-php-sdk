# Mercari API PHP SDK 

So, I wanted to snipe up a rare item from Mercari. If you ever tried to buy something rare, you know items go away in literal seconds. Almost inhumanly fast. And you guessed it, there's API to enable bots for sophisticated buyers. 

Mercari's API credentials are hard to come by, as Mercari is quite selective about who they grant it to. However, they also have a somewhat naive approach to internet security, requiring users to establish a local authenticated proxy server to allow their engineers to work with the API from the comfort of their homes. That's how yours truly gets to play with the API and buy something nice. In return, you get an API client, but please don't ask me for credentials or accesses. You'll need to figure that out through Mercari if you want to use this client.

This is a pretty complete Mercari API client, whipped up over a few holiday cocktails. It's working well for me right now, but hey, I'm just one person. Feel free to jump in and contribute! I'll probably tinker with it as I need stuff from Mercari, but this is open-source, baby! Add new methods, tweak things, make it your own. So I expect you, the user of this API client, to take the duty to be responsible for adding new methods, etc., with dignity and grace.
